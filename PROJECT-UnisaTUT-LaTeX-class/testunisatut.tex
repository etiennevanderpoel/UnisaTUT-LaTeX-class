\section{INTRODUCTION}
	
This document demonstrates some aspects of the {\tt unisatut.cls} class file to create Unisa styled tutorial letters.

\subsection{Files}

The {\tt unisatut} class consists of a number of files:
\begin{itemize}
	\item{{\tt unisatut.cls} - 
					the class definition}
	\item{{\tt testunisatut.tex} - 
					the \LaTeX\ source for this document}
	\item{{\tt testunisatut.pdf} - 
					the PDF output of this document}
	\item{{\tt unisabw.eps}, {\tt unisabw.pdf}, {\tt unisabw.ps} - 
					images for use in creating the tutorial letter front page and other bits}
	\item{{\tt unisatutpreamble.tex} - 
					load generic/global packages and definitions to use in all tutorial letters}
	\item{{\tt cheeseharpers.pjg} - 
					used as an example input image in this document}
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Usage}

Copy all the files into the same directory, or somewhere in the \LaTeX path. 
You can also create a separate directory for the graphic files 
	(see {\tt unisatutpreamble.tex} on how to set the path.)

Document class definition:
\wl 

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
\documentclass[options]{unisatut}
\end{lstlisting}
Options:
\begin{itemize}
	\item{{\tt nomathsf} - 
		by default, the class typesets mathematics using uses a Sans Serif font. 
		This option sets mathematics typesetting to a Serif (Roman) font.}
	\item{{\tt solution} - 
		this may not work properly, and has not been tested. 
		It is a remnant from Yorick's class that uses an {\tt assignment} environment and can include solutions.}
	\item{{\tt online} - also a remnant from the 2012 online MOOs. To be removed in a future version.}
\end{itemize}

The tutorial letter labels, such as modulecode, year, and so on, are controlled using variables defined 
	in the document preamble. 
{\tt Department} and {\tt School} are optional, and will not appear on the front page if not defined. 
The \LaTeX\ document should contain the following:
\wl

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
\documentclass[nomathsf]{unisatut} 

\TutName        {Tutorial Letter}
\ModuleCode     {YUM123C}
\TutNum         {102}
\ModuleSemester {1}
\ModuleYear     {2021}
\ModuleName     {Cheese Making}
\Department     {Silly Walks}
\School         {Fish}
\Content        {This document tests the unisatut.sty document class.}

%% INPUT pre-defined things that get used often
\input{unisatutpreamble.tex}

\begin{document}
Here be dragons!
\end{document}
\end{lstlisting}

The {\tt unisatutpreamble.tex} file can be used to define packages that are used regularly, 
	their settings, adjusting dimensions, and (re-)defining common commands.


\section{BITS FROM THE TUT101 TEMPLATE}

Here follows some bits from the standard Unisa Tut 101 template, executed in \LaTeX.


Dear Student

As part of this tutorial letter, we wish to inform you that Unisa has implemented a transformation 
	charter based on five pillars and eight dimensions. 
In response to this charter, we have also placed curriculum transformation high on the agenda. 
For your information, curriculum transformation includes the following pillars: student-centred 
	scholarship, the pedagogical renewal of teaching and assessment practices, the scholarship of 
	teaching and learning, and the infusion of African epistemologies and philosophies. 
These pillars and their principles will be integrated at both the programme and module levels, 
	as a phased-in approach. 
You will notice the implementation in your modules, and we encourage you to fully embrace these 
	changes during your studies at Unisa.  

\subsection{Getting started\ldots}

Given the nature of this module, you can read about it and find your study material online. 
Go to the website at \url{https://my.unisa.ac.za} and log in using your student number and password.

The image on cheese making image in Figure~\ref{FIG_harperscheese} 
	from \url{https://www.abebooks.com/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=30630061366}. 
The following text was liberated from Wikipedia's page on cheesemaking 
(\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheesemaking}) to use as a filler.

One of the ancient cheesemakers' earliest tools for cheesemaking, cheese molds or strainers, 
	can be found throughout Europe, dating back to the Bronze Age. 
Baskets were used to separate the cheese curds, but as technology advanced, these cheese 
	molds would be made of wood or pottery. 
The cheesemakers placed the cheese curds inside of the mold, secured the mold with a lid, 
	then added pressure to separate the whey, which would drain out from the holes in the mold. 
The more whey that was drained, the less moisture retained in the cheese. 
Less moisture meant that the cheese would be more firm. 
In Ireland, some cheeses ranged from a dry and hard cheese (mullahawn) to a semi-liquid cheese (mills√©n).

The designs and patterns were often used to decorate the cheeses and differentiate between them. 
Since many monastic establishments and abbeys owned their share of milk animals at the time, 
	it was commonplace for the cheeses they produced to bear a cross in the middle.

Although the common perception of cheese today is made from cow's milk, 
	goat's milk was actually the preferred base of ancient cheesemakers, 
	due to the fact that goats are smaller animals than cows. 
This meant that goats required less food and were easier to transport and herd. 
Moreover, goats can breed any time of the year as opposed to sheep, 
	who also produce milk, but mating season only came around during fall and winter.

Before the age of pasteurization, cheesemakers knew that certain cheeses can cause 
	constipation or kidney stones, so they advised their customers to supplement these 
	side effects by eating in moderation along with other foods and consuming walnuts, 
	almonds, or horseradish.

\section{OTHER EXAMPLES}

Here is a snippet from another source.



\subsection{A brief summary of the {\it k}-{\sc Nearest Neighbours} algorithm}

The {\it k}-{\sc Nearest Neighbours} ({\it k}{\sc NN}) algorithm is one of the simplest, though widely useful, classification algorithms. 
It works on the principle that instances of the same class tend to cluster together. 
In other words, a new instance is very likely to be of the same class as those closest to it.

A target function $f : X \rightarrow Y$, is represented by a set of $n$ instances $\langle X_i, Y_i\rangle$, 
	where $X = \{X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n\}$ are a set of attribute values. 
These attribute values could be coordinates, or any combination of values that belong to a specific instance. 
$Y_i$ typically represent a single class value that matches the attribute values of $X_i$. 
When a new instance $X_j = \{X_{j1}, X_{j2}, \ldots, X_{jn}\}$, of unknown class has to be classified, 
	{\it k}{\sc NN} calculates the distance between $X_j$ and each of the other instances. 
The $k$ nearest neighbours are selected, and their class values counted to determine the majority class. 
This majority class is then assigned to the new instance $X_j$. 

The distance measure is selected to match the data types of the instance attributes. 
These include the Euclidean distance, and the Manhattan distance. 
There are several others that are used. For example, if the attributes are coordinate values, 
	the Euclidean distance measure works well.

The value of $k$ is also critical to the algorithm. 
With $k=1$ the new instance will be assigned the class of the nearest neighbour, which may be an outlier, 
	and therefore not be an accurate representation of the classes. 
If $k=n$, the majority class value from all the instances are used, and there is no point in calculating the distances. 
A good heuristic value, that is often used is $k=\sqrt{n}$, or more specifically the nearest uneven integer to $\sqrt{n}$. 
The value of $k$ should be uneven so that there is always a majority outcome. 
There are also more sophisticated methods to determine good values for $k$, 
	some that use statistical methods, such as cross-validation.

An example will illustrate the workings of the algorithm. 
Consider the instance set in Figure~\ref{FIG_kNN}, showing 8 instances of two classes $A$ and $B$. 
A new instance $P_9$ at $(2,1)$ has an unknown class.

\caption{Instance space for {\it k}{\sc NN} with two classes $A$ and $B$.{\protect\label{FIG_kNN}}}
\end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Use {\it k}{\sc NN} to determine the new class for $C$. Using the heuristic, $k$ should be chosen as $k=3$, 
	but to illustrate the effect of different distance measures, use $k=5$. 
In other words find the 5 nearest neighbours to $C$.

Use the Euclidian distance measure 
	$$d_{Euclidian}(p,q) = \sqrt{(p_x - q_x)^2 + (p_y - q_y)^2}$$
	to calculate the distance between $P_9$ and the other 8 instances, and rank them according to the closest distance. 
The results are shown in Table~\ref{TAB_8_Euclidian}.
%
\begin{table}[hbtp]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{cc|c|c}
instance	& $d_{Euclidian}(P_9,P_i)$ 				& class	& rank \\ \hline
$P_1$		&	$5.385$	& $A$ 	& 7 \\
$P_2$		&	$3.606$	& $A$	& 5 \\
$P_3$		&	$1.000$	& $A$	& 1 \\
$P_4$		&	$2.000$	& $A$	& 2 \\
$P_5$		&	$3.000$	& $B$	& 4 \\
$P_6$		&	$2.236$	& $B$	& 3 \\
$P_7$		&	$8.485$	& $B$	& 8 \\
$P_8$		&	$4.000$	& $B$	& 6 
\end{tabular}
%
\caption{8 instances ranked using Euclidian distance.{\protect\label{TAB_8_Euclidian}}}
\end{table}


With $k=5$, the 5 closest neighbours gives 3 instances of class $A$ and 2 instances of class $B$. 
The majority is therefore class $A$, hence $P_9$ is assigned class $A$. 
The dashed circle in Figure~\ref{FIG_kNN}, with radius $r=3.606$ shows the minimum Euclidian radius that 
	encloses the 5 closest neighbours to $P_9$.

Now use the Manhattan distance measure
$$d_{Manhattan}(p,q) = |p_x - q_x| + |p_y - q_y|$$
to do the same calculation. The results are shown in Table~\ref{TAB_8_Manhattan}.
%
\begin{table}[hbtp]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{cc|c|c}
instance	& $d_{Euclidian}(P_9,P_i)$ 				& class	& rank \\ \hline
$P_1$		&	$7$		& $A$ 	& 7 \\
$P_2$		&	$5$		& $A$	& 6 \\
$P_3$		&	$1$		& $A$	& 1 \\
$P_4$		&	$2$		& $A$	& 2 \\
$P_5$		&	$3$		& $B$	& 3 \\
$P_6$		&	$3$		& $B$	& 4 \\
$P_7$		&	$12$	& $B$	& 8 \\
$P_8$		&	$4$		& $B$	& 5 
\end{tabular}
%
\caption{8 instances ranked using Manhattan distance.{\protect\label{TAB_8_Manhattan}}}
\end{table}

Now, the 5 closest neighbours gives a different result, with 2 instances of class $A$ and 3 instances of class $B$. 
The majority is therefore class $B$, hence $P_9$ is assigned class $B$. 
The cyan diamond in Figure~\ref{FIG_kNN}, with Manhattan radius $r=4$ shows the minimum Manhattan radius that 
	encloses the 5 closest neighbours to $P_9$. 
This illustrates the importance of choosing the correct distance measure for the data set. 
If $x$ and $y$ are simply coordinates, the Euclidian distance measure is appropriate, 
	but if $x$ and $y$ represent natural numbers (say $x$ are the number of petals on a flower, 
	and $y$ is the number of seed lobes), then the Manhattan distance may be a better choice.

It is often a good idea to normalise the data, so that all attributes fall within the same range, 
	i.e. have the same scale so that distance measures can compare the attributes equally.
